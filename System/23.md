via ssh ==  ```ssh <username>@<ip>```

via graphical session == ```ssh -X <username>@<ip>```

SSH X forwarding allows you to forward programs that use a graphical user 
interface through your remote SSH connection.

When connecting to a remote machine using SSH, simply add the -X flag and launch

If the private key you're using does not have the default name, or is not stored 
in the default path (not ~/.ssh/id_rsa), you must explicitly invoke it by:

Adding the -i flag and the path to your private key.
